Disease Name: NASAL POLYPS
Overview: Nasal polyps are noncancerous growths that develop in the lining of the nasal passages or sinuses. They are often associated with chronic inflammation and may obstruct the nasal passages, causing symptoms such as nasal congestion, loss of smell, facial pressure, and postnasal drip.
Symptoms: Common symptoms include nasal congestion, runny nose, postnasal drip, reduced or loss of sense of smell (anosmia), facial pain or pressure, snoring, and frequent sinus infections.
Causes: The exact cause of nasal polyps is not fully understood, but they are often associated with chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa, which can be triggered by conditions such as allergies, asthma, chronic sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, or certain immune disorders.
Risk Factors: Risk factors include a history of chronic sinusitis, asthma, allergies, cystic fibrosis, aspirin sensitivity (aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), and genetic predisposition.
Complications: Complications of nasal polyps may include recurrent sinus infections, obstructive sleep apnea, worsening of asthma symptoms, and the development of sinus or facial pain due to blockage of the nasal passages.
Preventions: Preventive measures include managing underlying conditions such as allergies or asthma, avoiding triggers such as airborne allergens or irritants, practicing good nasal hygiene, and seeking treatment for chronic sinusitis or nasal inflammation promptly.
Prescriptions/dosage remedies: Treatment may involve medications such as nasal corticosteroids, antihistamines, decongestants, saline nasal sprays, or oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and shrink the polyps. In some cases, surgical removal of the polyps may be necessary, particularly if they are large or causing significant symptoms.
Warning: Seek medical advice if symptoms persist or worsen, or if there are signs of complications such as severe nasal congestion, facial pain or pressure, recurrent sinus infections, or difficulty breathing.
